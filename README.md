The environmental concern comes from the estimated carbon footprint generated by the power plants providing that energy. And it isn't just mining that uses lots of power—a single Bitcoin transaction is estimated to burn 2,292.5 kilowatt hours of electricity, enough to power a typical US household for over 78 days.

"More and more computing power is needed to mine bitcoin, which requires more and more electricity. ASICs can be used to supercharge your mining, which uses even more electricity, and if bitcoin's price rises, it becomes even more profitable to mine, which causes more miners to jump into the game."

Why Cryptocurrencies Use So Much Energy
#

#
In recent months, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have plunged in value, yet the market capitalization for these digital currencies is still valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. That market cap has grown more than 20 times since last year, when the cryptocurrency boom began.
#
Digital currencies were made to be difficult to mine and take a lot of computing power to generate so no one person or group could take control of the entire network. This feature is part of what makes cryptocurrencies decentralized, meaning they have no single point of control. Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on what’s called a proof of work (PoW) system, which relies on people having to solve equations of varying difficulty to mine new coins and add new blocks of information to a digital currency's blockchain. This system was developed, in part, to counteract cyberattacks where one person creates a host of fake identities and uses them to take over a majority of the network.
#
Because everyone on the network is fighting to be the first to solve these equations and get the monetary reward, the person with the most processing power has the best chance to win. That leads people to put together larger mining rigs (or even networks of mining rigs) that grind through equations faster. Since the amount of energy used is reliant on the size of the mining network, ever increasing amounts of energy are needed to mine new coins.
#
The price and availability of electricity can also affect the volume of cryptocurrency mining operations. If electricity is cheaper in one country (or even part of a country) than another, it makes sense from a business standpoint to centralize mining operations there. 
With bitcoin's booming popularity comes problems. Speculation in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is rampant. Scams abound, and plenty of initial coin offerings (ICOs) have overpromised or underdelivered spectacularly.

#
A major issue that results from increased adoption has not been adequately addressed; they use a lot of energy. The "mining" process that creates bitcoin uses more energy than Serbia, says Digiconomist, a self-described "platform that provides in-depth analysis, opinions, and discussions with regard to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ... on a voluntary, best-effort basis.">
#
According to Bitcoinist, another industry site, the average cost in electricity to mine a bitcoin in Serbia is about $3,100, making it quite profitable to mine the coin there (among other countries with low-cost electricity).
#
As cryptocurrencies rise in price, the problem isn't going away. Right now, Digiconomist estimates that bitcoin mining, the process of generating bitcoins, accounts for 0.29% of the world's annual electricity consumption. The mining of a single bitcoin block—a block of tranasaction data on the bitcoin network—consumes enough energy to power more than 28 U.S. homes for a day.
#
Other cryptocurrencies that are structured similarly to bitcoin use energy for mining, too. Bitcoin is the most popular and best known cryptocurrency, but it is not unique in its energy needs.
#
Some people wonder if cryptocurrencies will disrupt the financial system, while others wonder if they will break the environment in the process.  Ref. Logan Kugler Communications of the ACM, July 2018, Vol. 61 No. 7, Pages 15-17

#### Why does NFT minting with cryptocurrency use so much energy?
* How does minting work?
#

#
Does Ethereum use a lot of energy?
![ethu ](https://github.com/jcsargis00/NFT-Research/blob/main/images/ethchart.PNG)
#

* Is energy used related to cryptocurrency price fluctuations?
* Can we predict how much energy will be used in the  future using machine learning?
* Is this an environmental concern?
* If it is, is there an eco friendly solution for NFT minting without cryptocurrency?
#
Ethereum average energy consumption per transaction compared to that of VISA as of January 10, 2022

#
WHAT IS THE REAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN?
Proof-of-work blockchain networks consume a very large amount of energy, which results in a very large amount of carbon being emitted. Best estimates place bitcoin around 45.8 TWh, emitting around 45,800,000 Tonnes of CO2 per year [1]. The annual power consumption from Ethereum activity is estimated to be 9.62TWh from September '19 - '20 [2].

### Bitcoin Energy Consumption Prediction with Machine Learning
#### Description of the source of data
2 datasources needed, environmental and  financial
#
Financial Dataset - Cryptocurrency Historical Prices from Kaggle
#
Cryptocurrency Prices by Market Cap - source Coin Gecko
#
The global cryptocurrency market cap today (5/26/22) is $1.29 Trillion, a -3.0% change in the last 24 hours.

Github
Description of the communication protocols
I am working solo and performing all of the 4 roles.

* Square role will be responsible for setting up the repository. This includes naming the repository and adding team members, which is just me.
* Triangle role - responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. Creating a simple model this early in the design process helps a team better understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. This also grants more time to work out the specifics related to machine learning.

Which model did you choose and why?
* Simple Regression/ Clustering, good fit for the  problem.  After plotting each ticker over a period of time, we can use machine learning to predict future pricing.  This calculation will also be performed on energy consumption versus popularity of NFTs, to predict future energy consumption.  Finally, an alternative solution will be presented to create NFTs with green technology.
#
How are you training your model?
* After scaling, 75% of data will be used for training, 25% of data will be used for testing
#
What is the model's accuracy? TBD
#
How does this model work? TBD

* Circle role - in charge of the mockup database. 

* X role - selection of technology for the project. 
#
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- SciKitLearn
- KMeans
- Mongo or DynamoDB
#
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
* Data Preprocessing  will involve selection, transformation,  and scaling of data.  Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage
* Mongo or DynamoDb will be the database for energy usage.
* Flask will be used to display the data.
* There will be 2 database tables, one for energy consumption and one for price fluctuation.
The tables will include fields for energy usage and price changes
* use Python to download the data from the Coinbase web site
Postgres will be the database for crypto pricing.
Fields of crypto pricing  model
- Symbol - The symbol for which the timeseries data refers
- Open - This is the opening price of the time period
- High - This is the highest price of the time period
- Low - This is the lowest price of the time period
- Close - This is the closing price of the time period
- Volume (Crypto) - This is the volume in the transacted Ccy. Ie. For BTC/USD, this is in BTC amount
- Volume Base Ccy - This is the volume in the base/converted ccy. Ie. For BTC/USD, this is in USD amount

There are 51 rows in this table, need to determine the top cryptocurrencies in the NFT marketplace from this information (website https://www.cryptowisser.com/nft-marketplaces/)
#### Machine Learning
* SciKitLearn is the ML library to create a classifier. 
* KMeans clustering algorithm to group similar currencies into classes.
* hvPlot and  Plotly  to create visualizaions in 2D and 3D as scatter plots.

#### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template,  D3.js will be integrated for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. Aleda.store will show an alternative solution. A tutorial and glossary of NFT and cryptocurrency terminology will be included, with links to references.

#### Github Branch location (only 1, since I am a solo team)
