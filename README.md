# NFT Energy Consumption, Environmental Concerns and Price Volatility
### Using Databases and Machine Learning for Cryptocurrency Energy Consumption and Price Volatility Research
#
#### Reason topic selected:
#
NFTs are created using blockchain and many are connected to cryptocurrency.  The environmental concern comes from the estimated carbon footprint generated by the power plants providing the energy used to mine NFTs. And it isn't just mining that uses lots of power—a single Bitcoin transaction is estimated to burn 2,292.5 kilowatt hours of electricity, enough to power a typical US household for over 78 days.   More and more computing power is needed to mine bitcoin, which requires more and more electricity. ASICs can be used to supercharge your mining, which uses even more electricity, and if Bitcoin's price rises, it becomes even more profitable to mine, which causes more miners to jump into the game.

* Cryptocurrency - cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, crypto, or coin is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
* CryptoPunk - A unique collectible avatar stored on Ethereum. There are three CryptoPunks listed in the top 10 most expensive NFTs ever sold.

* Discord - An instant messaging platform and the go-to place for discussing NFTs.

* ERC-721 - A token standard that allows for the creation of unique, non-fungible tokens. It differs from ERC-20, for example, which is used to mint fungible tokens.

* Ethereum - A blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ethereum is currently the main platform for NFT projects.

* Floor price - The lowest NFT price in any given category of NFTs. To “buy the floor” is to buy the cheapest NFT in a project / collection.


* Fractional ownership - Partial ownership rights over an NFT. Sellers can sell percentages of a work and buyers can buy what they can afford.

* Fungibility - Replaceability. Dollars are fungible because a dollar owed can be paid using any dollar in existence. Something that is non-fungible, like a painting, is one-of-a-kind.

* Gas fees - Fees that blockchain users pay to compensate for the computational resources used to execute transactions. Gas fees, which are largely specific to Ethereum, ensure that transactions will be genuine and discourages bad actors from spamming the network with a high volume of transactions.

* Hashmasks - Digital paintings made by a global team of 70 artists. Hashmasks are unique because consumers have some control over the art. According to the Hashmasks Manifesto, “Each holder has the ability to contribute to the completion of the art piece by giving a name of their preference to the Hashmasks they hold via the Name Change Token (NCT)”.

* Metadata - The collection of data that defines ownership and differentiates one NFT from another. Metadata can be on-chain or off-chain.  

* Metaverse - A virtual 3D world where people can interact. Popular blockchain-based environments that comprise the metaverse include Decentraland and The Sandbox, virtual gaming worlds where users can buy and sell land as NFTs.
* Mining - The method by which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generated and the transactions involving new coins are verified is known as mining. It entails massive, decentralised networks of computers all over the world that verify and safeguard blockchains, which are virtual ledgers that record crypto transactions.

* Minting - The process by which an NFT becomes part of the blockchain. Once an asset is put on the blockchain, it is “minted” as a token and cannot be altered.
* NFT - A non-fungible token is a financial security consisting of digital data stored in a blockchain, a form of distributed ledger. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain, and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.
#
![NFT](https://github.com/jcsargis00/NFT-Research/blob/main/images/nft.PNG)

* OpenSea - Launched in 2018, OpenSea is the first and largest NFT marketplace, boasting four million assets and 135+ DApps.

* Rarible - A community-owned NFT marketplace founded in 2020. The Moscow-based platform mostly hosts digital art, and is fuelled by its native ERC-20 token RARI.

* Royalties - Money earned by an NFT creator through the token’s resale. Some NFTs automatically pay royalties each time an NFT is sold. An NFT can be hardcoded to pay an artist royalties forever, an interesting use case that has the potential to shake up the music industry.

* Smart Contract - A self-executing digital contract. NFTs are composed of code written in smart contract programming language like Solidity.

Ethereum prices are highly volatile and have been for quite some time.
#
'Potential big move' - but not necessarily up - Ref. Coindesk 9/14/2021
Investors are expecting more volatility in ether (ETH) compared with bitcoin (BTC), according to a key metric, with the measure of risk at a six-month high amid a boom in decentralized finance (DeFi).
* The three-month spread between ether's volatility and bitcoin's has risen to 29%, the highest level since Feb. 23, according to data source Skew.  
* The metric, which tracks the difference in implied volatility for at-the-money options in both cryptocurrencies, has risen from -2.4% to 29% in two months. 
* Implied volatility is calculated from options prices and shows the market's opinion of the underlying asset’s potential moves. It is often considered a proxy of market risk.

### How is energy consumed by Bitcoin calculated?
![proc](https://github.com/jcsargis00/NFT-Research/blob/main/images/bitcoinprocess.PNG)
#
WHAT IS THE REAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN?
Proof-of-work blockchain networks consume a very large amount of energy, which results in a very large amount of carbon being emitted. Best estimates place bitcoin around 45.8 TWh, emitting around 45,800,000 Tonnes of CO2 per year [1]. The annual power consumption from Ethereum activity is estimated to be 9.62TWh from September '19 - '20 [2].

Github
Description of the communication protocols
I am working solo and performing all of the 4 roles.

* Square role will be responsible for setting up the repository. This includes naming the repository and adding team members, which is just me.
* Triangle role - responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. Creating a simple model this early in the design process helps a team better understand where and how a machine learning model will fit into the project. This also grants more time to work out the specifics related to machine learning.

Which model did you choose and why?
* Simple Regression/ Clustering, good fit for the  problem.  After plotting each ticker over a period of time, we can use machine learning to predict future pricing.  This calculation will also be performed on energy consumption versus popularity of NFTs, to predict future energy consumption.  Finally, an alternative solution will be presented to create NFTs with green technology.
#
How are you training your model?
* After scaling, 75% of data will be used for training, 25% of data will be used for testing
#
What is the model's accuracy? TBD
#
How does this model work? TBD

* Circle role - in charge of the mockup database. 

* X role - selection of technology for the project. 
#
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- SciKitLearn
- KMeans
- Mongo or DynamoDB
#
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
* Data Preprocessing  will involve selection, transformation,  and scaling of data.  Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage
* Mongo or DynamoDb will be the database for energy usage.
* Flask will be used to display the data.
* There will be 2 database tables, one for energy consumption and one for price fluctuation.
The tables will include fields for energy usage and price changes
* use Python to download the data from the Coinbase web site
Postgres will be the database for crypto pricing.
Fields of crypto pricing  model
- Symbol - The symbol for which the timeseries data refers
- Open - This is the opening price of the time period
- High - This is the highest price of the time period
- Low - This is the lowest price of the time period
- Close - This is the closing price of the time period
- Volume (Crypto) - This is the volume in the transacted Ccy. Ie. For BTC/USD, this is in BTC amount
- Volume Base Ccy - This is the volume in the base/converted ccy. Ie. For BTC/USD, this is in USD amount
#

There are 51 rows in this table, need to determine the top cryptocurrencies in the NFT marketplace from this information (website https://www.cryptowisser.com/nft-marketplaces/)
#### Machine Learning
* SciKitLearn is the ML library to create a classifier. 
* KMeans clustering algorithm to group similar currencies into classes.
* hvPlot and  Plotly  to create visualizaions in 2D and 3D as scatter plots.

#### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template,  D3.js will be integrated for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. Aleda.store will show an alternative solution. A tutorial and glossary of NFT and cryptocurrency terminology will be included, with links to references.

#### Github Branch location (only 1, since I am a solo team)

https://github.com/jcsargis00/NFT-Research
#
Takes in data from the provisional database
Outputs label for input data, plots and graphs for dashboard.

Summary and Followup Questions:
* Is energy used related to cryptocurrency price fluctuations?
* Can we predict how much energy will be used in the  future using machine learning?
* Is this an environmental concern?
* If it is, is there an eco friendly solution for NFT minting without cryptocurrency?
